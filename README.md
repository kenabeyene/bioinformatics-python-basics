ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics Python Basics

Welcome to my Bioinformatics Python Basics repository!
This repo contains 10 beginner-friendly Python projects that focus on bioinformatics concepts.
The goal is to build a strong Python foundation while applying programming to biological data.

ðŸš€ Projects Overview
ðŸ§© Project 1: DNA Sequence Analyzer

Description: Validate and analyze DNA sequences, including nucleotide counts, GC/AT content, and richness.

Concepts Used: Loops, conditionals, dictionaries, string operations

Skills Learned: Input validation, basic bioinformatics calculations, data organization in dictionaries

File Name: dna_sequence_analyzer.py

ðŸ§© Project 2: DNA to RNA Transcription

Description: Validate a DNA sequence and transcribe it to RNA by replacing thymine (T) with uracil (U).

Concepts Used: Loops, conditionals, string operations, input validation

Skills Learned: String manipulation, DNA-to-RNA conversion logic, validation of biological sequences

File Name: dna_to_rna_transcription.py

ðŸ§© Project 3: Complementary DNA Strand Generator

Description: Generate a complementary DNA strand based on base-pairing rules (Aâ†”T, Gâ†”C).

Concepts Used: Loops, conditionals, string concatenation

Skills Learned: Understanding base-pair complementarity, control flow, clean output formatting

File Name: complementary_dna_generator.py
