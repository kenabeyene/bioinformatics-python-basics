# ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics Python Basics

Welcome to my **Bioinformatics Python Basics** repository!  
This repo contains **5 beginner-friendly Python projects** that focus on **bioinformatics concepts**.  
The goal is to build a strong Python foundation while applying programming to biological data.

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

This repository marks the completion of my **Bioinformatics Python Basics** learning phase.  
Through these projects, Iâ€™ve learned how to:
- Write clean, modular Python code using functions  
- Apply programming logic to real biological data  
- Understand how bioinformatics problems can be solved with basic Python  

Next step: Moving on to **Pandas, NumPy, and advanced bioinformatics projects** ðŸš€
